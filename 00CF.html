The Procedure Name input box is where you
type in the name of the procedure you want
to locate.

You use the Search|Locate Function command to
find a declaration of a procedure, not its
instances.

Locate Function is particularly useful for
reviewing the definition of a procedure, as
well as for finding locations where you want
to set breakpoints and watches.

You can enter the name of a procedure or use
the <a href="030B.html">history list</a> to select one you've used
previously.

You can only type in procedure names that have
source code in a file that has been compiled
with debug information.

Library procedures can't be located because
their source code is unavailable.
