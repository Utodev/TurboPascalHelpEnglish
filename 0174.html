 | [X] Dual Monitor Support |
 +--------------------------+

[X] When you check Dual Monitor Support (and
click OK in the Startup Options dialog box),
the IDE comes up in dual-monitor mode the
next time you start it, if it detects
appropriate hardware.

If the appropriate hardware is not available,
this option is ignored.

 +--------------------------------------+
 | Default setting: Off ([ ] or no /D)  |
 |<a href="01BB.html"> Command-line equivalent: /D          </a>|
 +--------------------------------------+

Dual monitor mode is used for running or
debugging a program, or for shelling to DOS
(File|DOS Shell).

If your system has two monitors, DOS treats
one monitor as the active monitor. Use the
DOS MODE command to switch between the two
monitors (MODE CO80, for example, or MODE
MONO).

In dual monitor mode, the normal IDE screen
appears on the inactive monitor, and your
program's output goes to the active monitor.

When Dual Monitor Support is saved in your
options file and you type TURBO, TPX or BP at the
DOS prompt on one monitor, <i>Turbo</i> Pascal will
come up on the other monitor.

When you want to test your program on a
particular monitor, you must

 1) Exit the IDE.
 2) Switch the active monitor to the one you
    want to test with.
 3) Issue the TURBO or BP command again.

Program output will then go to the monitor
where you typed the TURBO command.

 ----------
  Warnings
 ----------
Do not change the active monitor (by using
the DOS MODE command, for example) while you
are in a DOS shell (File|DOS Shell).

Programs that directly access ports on the
inactive monitor's video card are not
supported, and can cause unpredictable
results.

When you run or debug programs that use dual
monitors, do not use dual monitor mode.

&raquo; NOTE: The Debug|User Screen command,
which normally displays the program output
screen, has no effect in dual monitor mode.
