 implementation (reserved word)
 --------------------------------
The implementation part of the unit is where you find the bodies of the
procedures and functions that are declared in the  <a href="0601.html">interface</a> part of the
unit.

The implementation part of the unit is the private part. Declarations made
here can be used only within this section of the unit.

All constants, types, variables, procedures, and functions in the interface
portion are visible in the implementation.

The implementation can have additional declarations of its own that are not
visible to any programs using the unit.

A <a href="061F.html">uses</a> clause can appear in the implementation, immediately following the
reserved word implementation.

If any procedures have been declared external, one or more <a href="0488.html">$L filename</a>
directive(s) should appear anywhere in the source file before the final <a href="05EB.html">end</a>
of the unit.

The normal (not inline) procedures and functions declared in the interface
must reappear in the implementation.

The <a href="0612.html">procedure</a>/<a href="05F7.html">function</a> header in the implementation should be either:
  - identical to the declaration in the interface, or
  - in the <a href="05FC.html">short form</a>
