 - Run|Run  (Ctrl+F9)
 ---------------------
The Run command runs your program, using
any parameters you pass to it with the
Run|<a href="0046.html">Parameters</a> command.

If the source code has been modified since
the last compilation, the compiler will
automatically do a make and link your
program.

If you don't want to debug your program, make
sure the Options|Compiler|<a href="010A.html">Debug Information</a>
check box is checked (on).

If you compile your program with the
<a href="011F.html">Integrated</a> Debugging check box checked, the
resulting executable code will contain
debugging information that affects the Run|Run
command in the following ways:

1. If you HAVE NOT modified your source code
since the last compilation:

 &raquo; The Run|Run command causes your program to
   run to the next breakpoint, or to the end
   if no breakpoints have been set.

2. If you HAVE modified your source code since
the last compilation, and:

 &raquo; If you ARE NOT stepping through your
   program, the compiler recompiles your
   program and sets it to run from the
   beginning.

 &raquo; If you ARE already stepping through your
   program, using the Run|<a href="0045.html">Step Over</a> or Run|
   <a href="0044.html">Trace Into</a> commands, Run|Run prompts you
   whether you want to rebuild the program.

   &raquo;&raquo; If you answer Yes, the compiler makes
      and links your program, and sets it to
      run from the beginning.
   &raquo;&raquo; If you answer No, your program runs to
      the next breakpoint--or to the end if
      no breakpoints are set.
