 $G:  Group Unit Segments Directive     (Windows and Protected mode)
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Specifies the groups of units you want the linker to place in the same
segment.

   Syntax:        {$G UnitName, UnitName ...}
   Type:          Local

 Target:
Windows and Protected mode

 Remarks:
The $G directive specifies the groups of units you want the linker to place
in the same segment. Grouping units in the same segment ensures that the
units swap in and out of memory at the same time. The $G directive is
primarily used to group units containing discardable code.

Each $G directive specifies a group of units. $G directives are only valid
in a program or library, and must appear after the program or library's uses
clause. The compiler reports an error if you attempt to add a unit to more
than one group. In addition to any groups created with $G, the compiler
maintains a default group that includes all units not explicitly grouped.

The linker minimizes the number of code segments in an executable file by
combining all units that belong to the same group. Two or more units are put
into the same code segment if they belong to the same group and have the
same code segment attributes, and if the combined size does not exceed the
preferred segment size.

The linker will never put units that belong to different groups in the same
code segment.
