 Browsing Objects
 -----------------
The Search|Objects command opens a window that displays a hierachy of all
of the object types used in your program.

If your object hierarchy is large, you can choose not to display
the descendants of a particular object. Select the object and press
the - (minus) key or click the horizontal line that attaches the
object to the hierarchy. The object now displays a + (plus) sign
next to it.

To see the descendants again, select the object and press the
+ (plus) key, or click the horizontal line that attaches the
object to the hierarchy.

To browse an object in the hierarchy, double-click it, or select
it and press Enter.

   Click on the letter (or symbol) or press:
 ==========Ñ========================================
     I     | at the top of the ObjectBrowser window to display
           | inheritance information for that object
     R     | at the top of the window to display a list of the
           | program or unit lines where that object is referenced
     S     | to display the object's declarations
 + (plus)  | to expand inheritance information
 - (minus) | to contract inheritance information

From the local Browser window, you can track or edit the
source code where the object is referenced if the listed symbol
is not stored in the run-time library.

If the ObjectBrowser does not find the source file
where the symbol is located, it displays a message telling
you the position where the symbol is found.

Change the directory information so the ObjectBrowser can find
where your source files are located.

If you modify your source code by adding or deleting program lines
after you have opened an ObjectBrowser, it's best to recompile
your program.
