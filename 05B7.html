  Pascal Types
 --------------
When you write a program, you work with information that generally falls
into one of five basic types: integers, real numbers, characters and
strings, Boolean expressions, and pointers.

<a href="0600.html">Integers</a> are whole numbers (1, 5, -21, and 752, for example).

<a href="0615.html">Real numbers</a> have fractional portions (3.14159) and exponents (2.579x1024).
These are also known as floating-point numbers.

<a href="05E4.html">Characters</a> are letters of the alphabet, symbols, and the numbers 0-9. They
 can be used individually (a, Z, !, 3) or combined into character strings
('This is only a test.').

<a href="05E2.html">Boolean</a> expressions have one of two possible values: True or False. They are
used in conditional expressions, which are discussed later.

<a href="0610.html">Pointers</a> hold the addresses of locations in the computer's memory, which in
turn hold information.
