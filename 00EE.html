 - Help on the Breakpoints dialog box
 -------------------------------------
The Breakpoints dialog box is where you set,
delete, and edit breakpoints. Whenever your
running program encounters a breakpoint, it
will stop with a execution bar positioned on the
line with the breakpoint.

This dialog box consists of a list box, the
standard OK and Help buttons, and four
additional buttons (Edit, Delete, View and
Clear All).

&raquo; NOTE: This dialog box has no Cancel button,
so edit and delete with care.

 +------------------------------------------+
The Breakpoint List list box shows each set
breakpoint plus its line number, conditions
and pass count setting.

There is a <a href="030B.html">history list</a> for conditions so you
can select a breakpoint condition you've used
before.

 +----------+
 |<a href="00EA.html"> [ Edit ] </a>|
 +----------+
The Edit button opens the Edit Breakpoint
dialog box so you can add a new breakpoint to
the list.

 +------------+
 |<a href="00EB.html"> [ Delete ] </a>|
 +------------+
The Delete button removes the breakpoint
that's highlighted in the Breakpoint List.

 +----------+
 |<a href="00EC.html"> [ View ] </a>|
 +----------+
The View button activates the Edit window and
moves the cursor to the selected breakpoint in
that window.

 +---------------+
 |<a href="00ED.html"> [ Clear All ] </a>|
 +---------------+
The Clear All button removes all the
breakpoints in the Breakpoint List.
