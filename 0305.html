 - GREP-like wildcards
 ----------------------
 +-----Â-----Â-----Â-----Â-----Â-------Â-----+
 |  ^  |  $  |  .  |  *  |  +  |  [ ]  |  \  |
 +-----Á-----Á-----Á-----Á-----Á-------Á-----+
 ----Â----------------------------------------------------------------
  ^  | A circumflex at the start of the string matches the start of a
     |   line.
  $  | A dollar sign at the end of the expression matches the end of
     |   a line.
  .  | A period matches any character.
  *  | An asterisk after a character matches any number of occurrences
     |   (including zero) of that character.
     |   For example, bo* matches bot, b, boo, and also be.
  +  | A plus sign after a character matches one or more occurrences
     |   (but not zero occurences) of that character.
     |   For example, bo+ matches bot and boo, but not b or be.
  [ ]| Characters in brackets match any one character that appears in
     |   the brackets, but no others.
     |   For example [bot] matches b, o, or t.
  [^]| A circumflex at the start of the string in brackets means NOT.
     |   Hence, [^bot] matches any characters except b, o, or t.
  [-]| A hyphen within the brackets signifies a range of characters.
     |   For example, [b-o] matches any character from b through o.
  \  | A backslash before a wildcard character tells <i> Turbo </i> Pascal to
     |  treat that character literally, not as a wildcard.
     |  For example, \^ matches ^ and does not look for the start
     |  of a line.
