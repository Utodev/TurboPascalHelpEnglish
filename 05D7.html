  PChar Operators
 -----------------
The extended syntax (enabled using a <a href="0485.html">{$X+} compiler directive</a>) supports a
number of new operations on character pointers.

The plus (+) and minus (-) operators can be used to increment and decrement
the offset part of a pointer value.

The minus operator can be used to calculate the distance (difference)
between the offset parts of two character pointers.

Assuming that P and Q are values of type PChar and I is a value of type
Word, these constructs are allowed:

   Construct     Result
   P + I         Add I to the offset part of P
   I + P         Add I to the offset part of P
   P - I         Subtract I from the offset part of P
   P - Q         Subtract offset part of Q from offset part of P

 P + I, I + P:
The operations P + I and I + P add I to the address given by P, producing a
pointer that points I characters after P.

 P - I:
The operation P - I subtracts I from the address given by P, producing a
pointer that points I characters before P.

 P - Q:
The operation P - Q computes the distance between Q (the lower address) and
P (the higher address), resulting in a value of type Word that gives the
number of characters between Q and P.

This operation assumes that P and Q point within the same character array.
If the two character pointers point into different character arrays, the
result is undefined.
