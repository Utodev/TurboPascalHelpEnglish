 | [ ] Group Undo |
 +----------------+

[X] When Group Undo is on, Edit|<a href="002D.html">Undo</a> reverses
the effects of the previous command and all
immediately preceding commands of the same
type.

These are "groupable" commands:
 &raquo; insertions
 &raquo; deletions
 &raquo; overwrites
 &raquo; cursor movements

For example, if you type ABC and Group Undo
is on, you can choose Undo one time to delete
the group ABC.

[ ] When Group Undo is off, Edit|Undo
reverses the effect of a single editor
command or keystroke.

For example, if you type ABC and Grouped Undo
is off, you must choose Undo three times to
delete the characters: C, then B, then A.

In terms of groups, inserting a carriage
return is considered an insertion followed by
a cursor movement.
