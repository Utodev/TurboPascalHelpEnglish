 - Run|Trace Into     (F7)
 -----------------
The Trace Into command runs your program
statement-by-statement. When it reaches a
procedure call, Trace Into executes each
statement within the procedure.

(Run|<a href="0045.html">Step Over</a> executes the procedure as a
single step).

 &raquo; If the statement DOES NOT contain any calls
   to procedures accessible to the debugger,
   Trace Into stops at the next executable
   statement.

 &raquo; If the statement DOES contain a call to a
   procedure accessible to the debugger, Trace
   Into halts at the beginning of the
   procedure's definition. Subsequent Trace
   Into or Step Over commands run the
   statements in the procedure's definition.

When the debugger leaves the procedure, it
resumes evaluating the statement that contains
the call.

Use the Trace Into command to move the execution
position into a procedure called by the one
you are currently debugging.

&raquo; NOTE: The Trace Into command only recognizes
procedures defined in a source file that has
been compiled with these two options
selected:

 &raquo; In the Options|Compiler dialog box, the
   <a href="010A.html">Debug Information</a> option must be checked.

 &raquo; In the Options|Debugger dialog box, the
   <a href="011F.html">Integrated</a> Debugging check box must be
   checked.

The debugger must also be able to find the
source file on your disk.
