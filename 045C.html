   /M Command-Line Option
 ------------------------
The /M command-line option instructs the command-line compiler to check all
units upon which the file being compiled depends.

A unit is recompiled if:
  - The source file for a given unit has been modified since the unit file
    was created.
  - The interface section of a unit referenced in a uses statement has
    changed.
  - If any linked .OBJ file is newer than the unit file.
  - If any .RES file is newer than the unit file.
  - If a unit contains an Include file and the Include file is newer than
    that unit file.

This option is identical to <a href="045B.html">/B</a>, except that it is conditional. (/M rebuilds
all files, regardless of whether they're out of date).

NOTE: Units in TURBO.TPL, TPP.TPL, and TPW.TPL are excluded from this
process.
