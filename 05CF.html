 Character strings
 -------------------
A character string is a sequence of characters from the extended ASCII
character set, written on one line in the program and enclosed by
apostrophes.

A character string with nothing between the apostrophes is a null string.
Two sequential apostrophes in a character string denote a single character,
an apostrophe.

The length attribute of a character string is the actual number of
characters within the apostrophes.

 Control characters:
As an extension to standard Pascal, Borland Pascal allows control characters
to be embedded in character strings.

The # character followed by an unsigned integer constant between 0 and 255
denotes a character of the corresponding ASCII value.

There must be no separators between the # character and the integer
constant.

Likewise, if several control characters are part of a character string,
there must be no separators between them.

  - A character string of length 0 (the null string) is compatible only with
    <a href="061B.html">string types</a>.
  - A character string of length 1 is compatible with any <a href="05E4.html">Char</a> and string
    type.
  - A character string of length N, where N is greater than or equal to 2,
    is compatible with the following:
  - any string type
  - packed arrays of N characters
  - the <a href="0610.html">PChar type</a> when extended syntax is enabled with the
    <a href="0485.html">{$X+}compiler directive</a>.
