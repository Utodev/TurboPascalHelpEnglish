 - Files List Box
 -----------------
The Files list box displays all these things:

 &raquo; All file names in the current directory
   that match the specifications in the
   input box
 &raquo; The parent directory
 &raquo; All subdirectories

To make the list box active, click it or press
Tab until the list box name is highlighted.

The Files list box is updated to show the
files in the directory you've currently
chosen.

You can use the Up or Down arrow keys to move
around and select a file name. Once you've
found the file you want, press Enter to open
it.

You can also double-click any file name in the
box to open that file. You might have to
scroll the box to see all the names.

Another way to move between files listed in
the Files list box is to type the first
letter(s) of the file name you want to go to.

Type a lowercase letter to search for a file
name and an uppercase letter to search for a
directory name.

On the bottom of the Files list box is a file
information panel that shows path name, file
name, date, time, and size of the selected
file. (None of the items on this panel are
selectable.)

As you scroll through the list, the panel is
updated for each file.
