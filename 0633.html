 TEML non-terminating commands I - N
 ------------------------------------

 Command                    | Action
 ============================================================================
 IndentBlock                | Inserts a space at the beginning of each line
                            | in the highlighted (selected) text.
 InsertText                 | Inserts the literal "string" in the buffer at
                            | the current cursor location. Use the
                            | syntax InsertText(string) to call this
                            | command.
 LeftOfLine                 | Moves cursor to beginning of the current line.
 LiteralChar                | Inserts the character at the current
                            | cursor location, without doing any special
                            | processing  for newline, tab characters, etc.
                            | Use the syntax LiteralChar(c), where c is a
                            | character or integer value. Ths macro places
                            | characters only into the editor and cannot be
                            | used to control the IDE menu system.
 MarkBufModified            | Sets a flag indicating that the contents of
                            | the buffer are different than what is in the
                            | corresponding disk file.
 MarkBufUnModified          | Clears a flag, thus indicating that the
                            | contents of the buffer can be assumed to
                            | be identical to what is in the disk file.
 MatchPairBackward          | Same as MatchPairForward except if the cursor
                            | is on a ' or ", searches backward for
                            | thematching character.
 MatchPairForward           | If the cursor is on one of the characters
                            | (, ), , , [, ], or on the first character of
                            | one of the pairs /* or */, searches in the
                            | appropriate direction for the closest
                            | instance of the matching delimiter. If the
                            | cursor is on the character ' or ", searches
                            | forward for the matching character. If a
                            | match is found, places the cursor there.
 MoveBlock                  | Like CopyBlock, but also deletes the original
                            | selected text.
 MoveToBlockBeg             | Moves cursor to the location marked as the
                            | beginning of the selected text.
 MoveToBlockEnd             | Moves cursor to the location marked as the end
                            | of the selected text.
 MoveToMark                 | Moves the cursor to the location saved
                            | with SetMark(n) command. Use syntax
                            | MoveToMark(n), where n is a one-digit number,
                            | 0-9.
 MoveToPrevPos              | Moves the cursor to the location specified by
                            | the "previous position marker."
 MoveToTempPos              | Moves the cursor to the saved temporary
                            | marker.
 NullCmd                    | No operation. Calls the editor, but performs
                            | no function. Can be used to cause a keystroke
                            | to have no effect.
