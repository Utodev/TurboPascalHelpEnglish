 InstallUserDriver (function)     <a href="064F.html">(Graph unit)</a>
 ----------------------------------------------
Installs a vendor-added device driver to the BGI device driver table

 Declaration:
 function InstallUserDriver(Name: string; AutoDetectPtr: pointer): integer;

 Target:
Real, Protected

 Remarks:
InstallUserDriver lets you use a vendor-added device driver. The Name
parameter is the file name of the new device driver. AutoDetectPtr is a
pointer to an optional autodetect function that might accompany the new
driver. This autodetect function takes no parameters and returns an integer
value.

If the internal driver table is full, InstallUserDriver returns a value of
-11 (grError); otherwise, InstallUserDriver assigns and returns a driver
number for the new device driver.

There are two ways to use this vendor-supplied driver. Suppose you have a
 new video card called the Spiffy Graphics Array (SGA) and that the SGA
manufacturer provided you with a BGI device driver (SGA.BGI). The easiest
way to use this driver is to install it by calling InstallUserDriver and
then passing the return value (the assigned driver number) directly to
InitGraph:

 var Driver, Mode: Integer;
 begin
   Driver := InstallUserDriver('SGA', nil);
   if Driver = grError then     { Table full? }
     Halt(1);
   Mode := 0;                    { Every driver supports mode of 0 }
   InitGraph(Driver, Mode, '');  { Override autodetection }
   ...                           { Do graphics ... }
 end.

The nil value for the AutoDetectPtr parameter in the InstallUserDriver call
indicates there isn't an autodetect function for the SGA.

The other, more general way to use this driver is to link in an autodetect
function that will be called by InitGraph as part of its hardware-detection
logic. Presumably, the manufacturer of the SGA gave you an autodetect
function that looks something like this:

 {$F+}
 function DetectSGA: Integer;
 var Found: Boolean;
 begin
   DetectSGA := grError;  { Assume it's not there }
   Found := ...           { Look for the hardware }
   if not Found then
     Exit;                { Returns -11 }
   DetectSGA := 3;        { Return recommended default video mode }
 end;
 {$F-}

DetectSGA's job is to look for the SGA hardware at run time. If an SGA is
not detected, DetectSGA returns a value of -11 (grError); otherwise, the
return value is the default video mode for the SGA (usually the best mix of
color and resolution available on this hardware).

This function takes no parameters, returns a signed, integer-type value, and
must be a far call. When you install the driver (by calling
InstallUserDriver), you pass the address of DetectSGA along with the device
driver's file name:

 var Driver, Mode: Integer;
   begin
     Driver := InstallUserDriver('SGA', @@DetectSGA);
     if Driver = grError then { Table full? }
       Halt(1);
     Driver := Detect;
     { Discard SGA driver #; trust autodetection }
     InitGraph(Driver, Mode, '');
     ...
 end.

After you install the device driver file name and the SGA autodetect
function, you call InitGraph and let it go through its normal autodetection
process. Before InitGraph calls its built-in autodetection function
(DetectGraph), it first calls DetectSGA. If DetectSGA doesn't find the SGA
hardware, it returns a value of -11 (grError) and InitGraph proceeds with
its normal hardware detection logic (which might include calling any other
vendor-supplied autodetection functions in the order in which they were
"installed").

If, however, DetectSGA determines that an SGA is present, it returns a
nonnegative mode number, and InitGraph locates and loads SGA.BGI, puts the
hardware into the default graphics mode recom-mended by DetectSGA, and
finally returns control to your program.
