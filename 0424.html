 Relocatable vs. Absolute Expressions
 -------------------------------------
Typically, an expression that refers to a label, variable, procedure, or
function is relocatable, and an expression that operates solely on constants
is absolute.

A relocatable expression denotes a value that requires relocation at link
time. (Relocation is the process by which the linker assigns absolute
addresses to symbols.)

An absolute expression denotes a value that requires no such relocation.

At compile time, the compiler does not know the final address of a label,
variable, procedure, or function.

The final address does not become known until link time, when the linker
assigns a specific absolute address to the symbol.

The built-in assembler allows you to carry out any operation on an absolute
value, but it restricts operations on relocatable values to addition and
subtraction of constants.
