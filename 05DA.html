  The @ ("at") operator: Pointer operation
 ------------------------------------------
 You can create a pointer to a variable with the @ operator.

   Operator|Operation        |Operand types         |Result type
  =========================================================================
   @       |Pointer formation|Variable reference,   |Pointer (same as nil)
           |                 |procedure identifier, |
           |                 |or function identifier|

@ is a unary operator. Special rules apply to use of the @ operator with a
<a href="05B9.html">procedural variable.</a>

The type of the value is the same as the type of nil, so it can be assigned
to any pointer variable.

 @ with a variable:
Using @ with an ordinary variable (not a parameter) is not complicated. For
example, given these declarations:

   type
     TwoChar = array[0..1] of Char;
   var
     Int: Integer;
     TwoCharPtr: ^TwoChar;

this statement causes TwoCharPtr to point to Int:
   TwoCharPtr := @Int;

TwoCharPtr^ becomes a reinterpretation of the value of Int, as if it were an
array[0..1] of Char.

 @ with a value parameter:
Applying @ to a formal value parameter results in a pointer to the stack
location containing the actual value.

For example, suppose Fred is a formal value parameter in a procedure and
FredPtr is a pointer variable.

If the procedure executes this statement
   FredPtr := @Fred;

FredPtr^ references Fred's value.

However, FredPtr^ does not reference Fred itselfit references the value that
was taken from Fred and stored on the stack.

 @ with a variable parameter:
Applying @ to a formal variable parameter results in a pointer to the actual
 parameter (the pointer is taken from the stack).

The type of resulting pointer value is controlled through the $T compiler
directive.

For example, suppose the following:
  - One is a formal variable parameter of a procedure,
  - Two is a variable passed to the procedure as One's actual parameter
  - OnePtr is a pointer variable.

If the procedure executes this statement
   OnePtr := @One;

OnePtr is a pointer to Two, and OnePtr^ is a reference to Two itself.

 @ with a procedure or function:
You can apply @ to a procedure or a function to produce a pointer to its
entry point. Turbo Pascal does not give you a mechanism for using such a
pointer.

The only use for a procedure pointer is to pass it to an assembly language
routine or to use it in an <a href="05FF.html">inline</a> statement.

 @ with a method:
You can apply @ to a qualified method identifier to produce a pointer to the
method's entry point.
