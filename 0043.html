 - Run|Go to Cursor     (F4)
 -------------------
The Go to Cursor command runs your program
from the execution bar to the line the cursor is
on in the current edit window.

(The execution bar is the highlighted bar in your
source code.)

If the cursor is at a line that does not
contain an executable statement, <i>Turbo</i> Pascal
displays a warning.

The Go to Cursor command can also initiate
a debug session.

Although Go to Cursor does not set a permanent
breakpoint, it does allow the program to stop
at a permanent breakpoint if it encounters one
before reaching the line the cursor is on. If
this occurs, you must choose Go to Cursor
again.

Use Go to Cursor to advance the execution bar to the
part of your program you want to debug.

If you want your program to stop at a certain
statement every time it reaches that point,
set a breakpoint on that line.
