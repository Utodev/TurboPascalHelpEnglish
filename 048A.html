 $C:  Code Segment Attribute      (Windows and Protected mode)
 --------------------------------------------------------------
Controls the attributes of a code segment.

   Syntax:     {$C Attribute Attribute}
   Default:    {$C MOVEABLE DEMANDLOAD DISCARDABLE}
   Type:       Global

 Remarks:
Every code segment in an application or library has a set of attributes that
determine its behavior when it is loaded into memory.

A $C directive affects only the code segment of the module (unit, program or
library) in which it is placed.

The code segment attributes occur in groups of two. Each option has an
opposite toggle:

   Option      | Meaning
   ========================================================================
   MOVEABLE    | The system can change the location of the code segment in
               | memory.
   FIXED       | The system cannot change the location of the code segment
               | in memory.
   PRELOAD     | The code segment loads when your program begins execution.
   DEMANDLOAD  | The code segment loads only when it is needed.
   PERMANENT   | The code segment remains in memory once it is loaded.
   DISCARDABLE | The code segment can be unloaded when it is no longer
               | needed.

If both options are specified, only the last one will take effect.

For example
  {$C FIXED MOVABLE DISCARDABLE}
will make the code segment moveable and it can be discarded when it is no
longer needed.
