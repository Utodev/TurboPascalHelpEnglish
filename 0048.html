 - Compile|Make  (F9)
 ---------------------
The Make command makes an .EXE file.

These are the rules governing which files and
units are recompiled:

 &raquo; If <a href="004C.html">Compile|Primary File</a> lists a primary
   file, that file is compiled; otherwise,
   the file in the active edit window is
   compiled.

   <i>Turbo</i> Pascal checks all files that the file
   being compiled depends on.

 &raquo; If the source file for a given unit has
   been modified since the .TPU, .TPP or .TPW (object code)
   file was created, that unit is recompiled.

 &raquo; If the interface for a given unit has been
   changed, all other units that depend upon
   it are recompiled.

 &raquo; If a unit links in an .OBJ file (external
   routines), and the .OBJ file is newer than
   the unit's .TPU, .TPP, or .TPW file, the unit is
   recompiled.

 &raquo; If a unit includes an Include file and the
   Include file is newer than that unit's .TPU, .TPP, or .TPW
   file, the unit is recompiled.

This option is identical to Compile|<a href="0049.html">Build</a>,
except that it is conditional.

(Build rebuilds all files, regardless of
whether they're out of date).
