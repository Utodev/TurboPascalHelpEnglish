 - Window Basics
 ----------------
Most of what you see and do in the <i>Turbo</i>
Pascal environment happens in a window.

A window is a bordered screen area that you
can move, resize, zoom, rearrange, close,
and open.

<i>Turbo</i> Pascal makes it easy to spot the active
window; it always has a double-lined border
around it, and it always has these elements:

    <a href="01D4.html"> Close </a>                <a href="05B4.html"> Zoom  </a>
    <a href="01D4.html">  box  </a>                <a href="05B4.html">  box  </a>
       |                      |
       V                      V
   <a href="05B2.html"> É=[&raquo;]===== Title Bar ====[ ]=»</a>
    º                            ±
    º                            ±
    º                            ±
    º                            &raquo;
    º                            ±
    º                            ±&lt;----+
    º                            ±     |
    È=±±&raquo;±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±==¼     |
                     ^                 |
                     +-----------------´
                                       |
                                <a href="05B3.html"> Scroll Bars </a>

You can have any number of windows open in
<i>Turbo</i> Pascal (memory allowing), but only one
window can be active at any time. The active
window is the one that you're currently
working in.

Generally, any command you choose or text you
type applies only to the active window. (But
if you have the same file open in several
windows, the action applies to the file in
each of those windows.)

If your windows overlap, the active window is
always the topmost one (the one on top of all
the others).

The first nine windows you open in <i>Turbo</i>
Pascal display a window number in the title
bar.

Alt-W L brings up the <a href="0193.html">Window List dialog box</a>,
which lists all opened windows.

To make a window active (topmost), press Alt
and the window number. For example, if the
Help window is #5 but is buried under the
other windows, you can press Alt-5 to quickly
bring it to the front.

Edit windows also show the cursor's position
(the current line and column number) as YY:XX
in the bottom of the Edit window frame, where
YY is the line number and XX is the column
number.
