 Built-in Assembler Expression Types
 ------------------------------------
Every built-in assembler expression has an associated type.

This type is a size, because the built-in assembler regards the type of an
expression as the size of its memory location.

The built-in assembler performs type checking whenever possible; an error
results if the type check fails.

You can use a typecast to change the type of a memory reference. For
 example, all of these refer to the first (least significant) byte of the
OutBufPtr variable:

 asm
   MOV     DL,BYTE PTR OutBufPtr
   MOV     DL,Byte(OutBufPtr)
   MOV     DL,OutBufPtr.Byte
 end;

In some cases, a memory reference is untyped (it has no associated type);
for example, an immediate value enclosed in square brackets:

 asm
   MOV     AL,[100H]
   MOV     BX,[100H]
 end;

The built-in assembler permits both of these instructions because the
 expression [100H] has no associated type (it just means "the contents of
address 100H in the data segment") and the type can be determined from the
 first operand (byte for AL, word for BX).

In cases where the type cannot be determined from another operand, the
built-in assembler requires an explicit typecast, like this:

 asm
   INC     BYTE PTR [100H]
   IMUL    WORD PTR [100H]
 end;
