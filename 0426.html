 Built-in Assembler Expression Symbols
 --------------------------------------
The built-in assembler provides access to almost all Pascal symbols in
assembler expressions, including labels, constants, types, variables,
procedures, and functions.

The built-in assembler also provides several <a href="031F.html">predefined type symbols</a>.

   Symbol    | Value                | Class     | Type
   ===========================================================
   Label     | Address of label     | Memory    | Short
   Constant  | Value of constant    | Immediate | 0
   Type      | 0                    | Memory    | Size of type
   Field     | Offset of field      | Memory    | Size of type
   Variable  | Address of variable  | Memory    | Size of type
   Procedure | Address of procedure | Memory    | Near or Far
   Function  | Address of function  | Memory    | Near or Far
   Unit      | 0                    | Immediate | 0
   @Code     | Code segment address | Memory    | 0FFF0H
   @Data     | Data segment address | Memory    | 0FFF0H
   @Result   | Result var offset    | Memory    | Size of type

 Symbols that cannot be used in Built-in Assembler Expressions:
The following symbols cannot be used in built-in assembler expressions:
  - Standard procedures and functions (for  example, WriteLn, Chr)
  - The special arrays Mem, MemW, MemL, Port and PortW
  - String, floating-point, and set constants
  - Procedures and functions declared with the <a href="05FF.html">inline directive</a>
  - <a href="0431.html">Labels</a> that are not declared in the current block
  - The @Result symbol outside a function.

 Local Variables:
Local variables (variables declared in procedures and functions) are always
allocated on the stack and accessed relative to SS:BP.

The value of a local-variable symbol is its signed offset from SS:BP.

The built-in assembler automatically adds [BP] in references to local
variables.

 Var Parameter:
The built-in assembler always treats a var parameter as a 32-bit pointer,
and the size of a var parameter is always 4 (the size of a 32-bit pointer).

To access the contents of a var parameter, you must first load the 32-bit
pointer and then access the location it points to.

 Scope:
A scope is provided by type, field, and variable symbols of a record or
object type.

In addition, a unit identifier opens the scope of a particular unit, just
like a fully-qualified identifier in Pascal.

 Operator:
Some symbols, such as record types and variables, have a scope that can be
accessed using the <a href="0436.html">structure member selector</a> (.) operator.

 Type Identifier:
You can use a type identifier to construct variables as you write your
program.

Each of these instructions generates the same machine code, which loads the
contents of ES:[DI+4] into AX:

 asm
   MOV     AX,(Rect PTR ES:[DI]).B.X
   MOV     AX,Rect(ES:[DI]).B.X
   MOV     AX,ES:Rect[DI].B.X
   MOV     AX,Rect[ES:DI].B.X
   MOV     AX,ES:[DI].Rect.B.X
 end;
