 {$E} Emulation Switch
 -----------------------
Enables or disables linking with an 80x87-emulating run-time library

   Syntax: {$E+} or {$E-}
   Default: {$E+}
   Type: Global
   Menus: <a href="010E.html">[X] Emulation</a>

 Target:

 Real mode, Protected mode
The $E directive enables or disables linking with a run-time library that
emulates the 80x87 numeric coprocessor if one is not present.

 The {$N+,E+} State:
When you compile a program in the {$N+,E+} state, the compiler links with
the full 80x87 emulator.

The resulting .EXE file can be run on any machine, regardless of whether
that machine has an 80x87. If an 80x87 is present, the program will use it;
otherwise, the run-time library emulates it.

 The {$N+,E-} State:
In the {$N+,E-} state, the compiler links with a substantially smaller
floating-point library, which can only be used if an 80x87 is present at run
time.

The {$E} (80x87 emulation) switch has no effect if used in a unit; it
applies only to the compilation of a program.

 The {$N-,E+} State:
If the program is compiled in the {$N-} state, and if all the units used by
the program were compiled with {$N-}, then an 80x87 run-time library is not
required, and the 80x87 emulation switch is ignored.
